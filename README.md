 Welcome to stock calculator!!
Here you can see wether your stocks are making you profit or giving you loss. Stock calculator works on three entries those are initial stock value the amount of stocks you purchased and the current stock value.
Then after entering these values you can know the amount of profit or loss and the percent of profit/loss too.
